	I'm an enjoyer of FOSS, especially Linux. I like gaming a lot. I play Minecraft, CS2, Scarlet
	Hollow, which I speedran in a day and a whole lot of other games. All of these games, with the
	exception of Minecraft, I got through Steam. I'm from Slovenia, which is a small country in
	central Europe.

	<a href="gregtech.eu">gregtech.eu</a> is my own Lemmy server, and also a Matrix server. If you'd like
	an account on Lemmy, you can do so without my permission, but for Matrix you would have to contact
	me. I host it all at Hetzner in Helsinki, but my Minecraft server is hosted on a Raspberry Pi at home.
