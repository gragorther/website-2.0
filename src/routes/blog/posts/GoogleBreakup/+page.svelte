	<h2>Why Google might get split up</h2>
	<p>
		The US Department of Justice has asked a federal court to force Google to sell Chrome, one of
		its largest assets, following the ruling that Google is illegally maintaining a monopoly on its
		search engine by Judge Amit P. Mehta. He has been asked by the government to either have Google
		sell Android or stop forcing manufacturers to put its services onto Android phones.
		Additionally, Google could be obliged to stop paying other browser companies to be the default
		search engine, and also allow rivals to access Google's results and data.

		Losing Chrome would be an enormous loss for Google, because 67% of internet users use Chrome,
		according to Statcounter. Without Android, Google's scheme to keep people using their products
		would suffer quite the blow, because they would no longer be able to have their servicese
		preinstalled on most Android devices.

	<h2>Breaking up Google isn't a good idea</h2>
